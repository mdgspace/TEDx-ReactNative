## About 
TEDxIITRoorkee is organized by a group of enthusiasts who form a part of the Entrepreneurship Development Cell. In 2017, [Mobile Development Group](https://mdg.sdslabs.co) built a mobile app for TEDx to help the attendees keep a track of its speakers, topics of ted talks, sponsors and organising committee. The app was built on `react-native` which is a modern framework for developing cross platform mobile apps. Read more about `react-native` [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
